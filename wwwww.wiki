§ wwwww

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**wwwww** is a Mathematical Abbreviation that means either —

• //which was what was wanted//, or
• //which was what we wanted//.

**wwwww** is put at the end of Mathematical proofs, to signify that you are at //the end of the proof//.

Other things that are also used in the same way as **WWWWW** include —

• **QED** (which is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase [[quod-erat-demonstrandum]], which means "which was to be proved" or "which was to be demonstrated"), and
• a filled in [[square]] — such as ∎ (U+220E).
