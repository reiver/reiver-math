§ Imaginary Unit

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In [[math]], the **imaginary unit** is denoted by ``i``, and is defined as —

i = √‾‾-1‾‾

§§ operator j

With **imaginary number**s, the //[[square-root]] of negative one// is usually denoted as ``i``.
I.e., —

i = √‾‾-1‾‾

This creates a problem if you are dealing with [[electromagnetism]] — where ``i`` (and ``I``) is commonly used to denote [[electric-current]].

In this situation ``j`` (rather than ``i``) is used to denote the [[imaginary-unit]].
I.e., —

i = √‾‾-1‾‾

This is often called **operator j**.

This should //not// be confused with the use of ``j`` from [[quaternion]]s.
They are //not// the same.
