§ Imaginary Number

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

In [[math]], an **imaginary number** is a [[real-number]]s or [[integer]]s multiplied to the [[imaginary-unit]], which is denoted by ``i``.

§§ Example Imaginary Numbers

Some examples of complex numbers include:

i

2i

-2i

2.3i

-2.3i

πi

-πi

i√‾‾5‾‾

-i√‾‾5‾‾

Numbers such as —

2i + 3

i - π

π - i

π - i√5

— are //not// called **imaginary number**s, but are instead called [[complex-number]]s.

§§ operator j

With **imaginary number**s, the //[[square-root]] of negative one// is usually denoted as ``i``.
I.e., —

i = √‾‾-1‾‾

This creates a problem if you are dealing with [[electromagnetism]] — where ``i`` (and ``I``) is commonly used to denote [[electric-current]].

In this situation ``j`` (rather than ``i``) is used to denote the [[imaginary-unit]].
I.e., —

i = √‾‾-1‾‾

This is often called **operator j**.

This should //not// be confused with the use of ``j`` from [[quaternion]]s.
They are //not// the same.
