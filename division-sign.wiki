§ Division Sign

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **division sign** (**÷**) is used to denote [[mathematical-division]].

The symbol for the **division sign** is a horizontal bar with one dot slightly above the center of the horizontal bar, and another dot slightly below the center of the horizontal bar.
The 2 dots line up vertically.

§§ Name

The **division sign** is sometimes also called the **division symbol**.
The **division sign** seems to also sometimes be called an **obelus** — whose plural form is: **obeli** — although ther are other things called //obelus// & //obeli// that are //not// the **division sign**.

§§ Example

He is an example of the **division sign** in usage.

10 ÷ 5 = 2

This would read as — //ten divided by 5 equals 2//.

§§ Divided By

I.e., in this context, the **division sign** (**÷**) reads a //divided by//.

§§ HTML

The **division sign** can be created in HTML with "``&divide;``".
For example —

	  10 &divide; 5 = 2

§§ Other Symbols And Notations For Division

Other symbols exist for [[mathematical-division]].
For example, the [[long-division-symbol]], the [[solidus]], the [[fraction-slash]], and a horizonal-line (used in [[mathematical-fraction]]s]).

So, for example, all of these are equivalent —

10 ÷ 5

5 )‾‾ 10 ‾‾

10 / 5

''10''⁄,,5,,

10⁄5


__10__
5

§§ HTML Fraction Slash

Note, if you want to use fraction like notation in HTML, you can use the HTML "``&frasl;``" entity.
For example —

	10&frasl;5

Really though, if you want to make it look like a fraction, you need to the HTML <sup> element and the HTML <sub> Element too.
So —

	<sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>

	'(('))10'(('))⁄,((,))5,((,))
